# Human-Emotion-Detection

Python Natural Language Processing program to detect human emotion using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

It is a supervised learning algorithm and a binary classification

Dataset is from Kaggle: [Kaggle Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sankha1998/emotion)

## Update Multiclass

This directory contains the updated script for performing multiclass emotion detection using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. The script utilizes natural language processing techniques to classify human emotions.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at the following link: [Kaggle Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sankha1998/emotion)

### Usage

To use the updated script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `update_multiclass` directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script using the command `python main.py` if you want to train the model with a new dataset.
5. Run the script using the command `python inference.py` if you want to perform inference with the model.
6. For the glove embedding, download it from this link: [Glove Embedding](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielwillgeorge/glove6b100dtxt)

### Results

After running the script, the multiclass emotion detection model will be trained and evaluated. The results will be displayed, providing insights into the performance of the model.
