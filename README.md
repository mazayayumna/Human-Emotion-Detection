## Sentiment Analysis Models
This repository contains implementations of sentiment analysis models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). There are two main scripts available:

### 1. emosi_manusia_nlp_cnn.py
Description: This script implements a CNN-based model for sentiment analysis with binary output (happy or sad). The model is derived from a Jupyter Notebook. <br />
Usage: Run emosi_manusia_nlp_cnn.py to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model with Jupyter Notebook.

### 2. update_multiclass/main.py
Description: This script implements a CNN-based model for sentiment analysis with multiclass output. It is developed as a standalone Python script and does not require Jupyter Notebook. <br />
Usage: Refer to README.md in the folder for detailed information on how to use and adapt the script for your specific dataset and requirements.
